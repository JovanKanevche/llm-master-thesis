# Autonomous Governance:
# Bridging Artificial Intelligence & Blockchain in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

This repository contains everything needed to implement our project "Autonomous Governance: Bridging Artificial Intelligence & Blockchain in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations". Our project uses Python and the AutoGen framework to integrate the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain in governance tasks within DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). Here's what you need to get started:

1. Make sure you have Python version 3.x and pip package manager installed. If not, download them from [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py), respectively.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt, and type the following command to install the required dependencies:

```sh
$ pip install autogen
```

Our project comprises two primary modules integrated through the AutoGen framework - the proposal evaluator and the membership approver. Let us take a closer look at each one:

## Proposal Evaluator
The proposal evaluator uses the state-of-the-art GPT-4 AI language model to assess proposals objectively based on preset parameters. This component offers considerable advantages over traditional methods since it eliminates subjectivity and provides accurate results founded upon data analysis and pattern identification.
To launch this functionality, navigate to its directory and type:
```sh
$ python app/proposal-evaluator.py
```

## Membership Approver
The membership approver employs smart contract technology combined with AI algorithms to handle new member requests in a safe and transparent manner. Leveraging blockchain's inherent security characteristics, this system guarantees reliable administration and monitoring of member submissions.
To activate this function, visit its location and input:
```sh
$ python app/membership-approver.py
```

As AI and blockchain continue to progress, there are numerous opportunities to reimagine organizational procedures, particularly for DAOs. Nevertheless, it is essential to balance these advancements with fundamental principles such as transparency, impartiality, and responsibility.

Please do not hesitate to contact us should you encounter any issues or have suggestions about further enhancing autonomous governance. We appreciate community engagement and collaboration toward developing more refined solutions in this area. Thanks for stopping by!
